          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <p><em>Echoes of Extinction</em> was a project born from the video game development degree at the University of Girona, as part of a course focused on game engines. We were a group of six students and decided to develop a first-person zombie shooter. Each team member was responsible for different aspects of the game, and I personally chose to take on the task of AI development. I already had experience working with Unity's navigation meshes (NavMesh), as well as implementing state machines synchronized with animations for better control of zombie behavior.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="text-block">
          <h1>ðŸ§Ÿ Zombie Mechanics (AI)</h1>
          <p>At first glance, it might seem like this mechanic simply involved using Unity's NavMesh and calling it a day. However, the system went far beyond just placing a 3D model and assigning it a target.</p>
      
          <h2>Visual Design vs. Behavior</h2>
          <p>The zombie system could be divided into two main components:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>ðŸŽ¨ Visual aesthetics</strong></li>
            <li><strong>ðŸ§  Behavior</strong></li>
          </ul>
      
          <h2>ðŸŽ¨ Visual Aesthetics</h2>
          <p>Due to the limited time available, we decided to use free assets instead of creating models and animations from scratch. We aimed for a realistic visual style, avoiding low-poly or cartoon-like models, which significantly reduced our available options.</p>
      
          <h3>First problem with free assets: high poly models</h3>
          <p>Many free zombie models had extremely high polygon counts, some reaching up to 100,000 triangles. This was unmanageable for performance, especially when spawning more than 20 zombies at once. I used Blenderâ€™s <strong>Decimate</strong> modifier and retopology plugins to reduce each model to about 5,000 triangles, allowing 20 optimized zombies to match the cost of a single original one.</p>
      
          <p>To save time on animations, I used <strong>Mixamo</strong> to obtain pre-rigged animations. This let me skip the entire rigging process and get animated models into Unity quickly.</p>
      
          <p>I also created visual variety by recoloring clothes and applying different textures, resulting in four distinct zombie variants for each zombie model.</p>
      
          <h2>ðŸ§  Behavior (Mechanics)</h2>
          <p>The AI was based on Unityâ€™s NavMesh system, but included much more than basic pathfinding.</p>
          <p>Before I implemented the base zombie behavior, a teammate will work on a <strong>zombie boss</strong> that could spit toxic projectiles. Since both shared some logic but differed in others, we applied good software architecture practices and structured the code as follows:</p>
      
          <ul>
            <li><code>Zombie</code> (base class)</li>
            <li><code>ZombieBoss</code> (inherits from <code>Zombie</code>)</li>
          </ul>
      
          <p>Key methods included:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>Update()</code>: State machine logic</li>
            <li><code>Die()</code>: Triggers a random death animation</li>
            <li><code>Attack()</code>: Plays a random attack animation and detects collisions with players or doors. For the boss, this launches a projectile.</li>
            <li><code>TakeDamage()</code>: Reduces health, plays damage animation, and pauses navigation momentarily</li>
          </ul>

          <p>All behaviors were connected to Unityâ€™s Animator Controller using parameters and transitions.</p>
          <h3>Class Diagram</h3>
          <p>This UML diagram shows the relationship between the base <code>Zombie</code> class and the derived <code>ZombieBoss</code> class:</p>

          <h2>Design Inspiration and Gameplay Decisions</h2>
          <p>I drew inspiration from <em>Call of Duty</em> zombies. I made zombies always aware of the playerâ€™s location, even from across the map. This constant tension created exciting moments when enemies grouped up in chokepoints like staircases or doors.</p>
      
          <p>Zombies were also able to attack closed doors. To implement this, I modified our door GameObjects to communicate their state (open or closed) when a zombie entered their trigger. If open, the zombie passed through. If closed, it would stop and attack until the door was destroyed.</p>
      
          <p>When baking the NavMesh, we didnâ€™t mark doors as obstacles, so zombies still considered them part of the optimal path. This design encouraged aggression and tension, keeping players on their toes.</p>
